An awesome article: <%= @article.title %>

Hello, <%= @user.name %>!
We'd like to inform you that we have an awesome article published on localhost!
It's written by <%= @article.author.name %> just on <%= @article.created_at %>.
<% if @article.created_at != @article.updated_at %>
 It's been updated just on <%= @article.updated_at %>.
<% end %>
 You certainly should read it!

<%= url_for controller: :article, action: :read, id: @article.id %>

Sincerely yours, InfoMailer.
